# EatBurger

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets you input the name of your favourite burger.

* Whenever you submit a burger name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the (left side) waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* The burgers you submit are stored in the database, devoured or not.
